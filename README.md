## Changelog

:page_with_curl: See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Versions

Two image versions are available:

- **`latest`**: Based on `alpine:3` with daily automated builds to include the most recent security patches
- **Version tags** (e.g., `3.4.1.1`): Specific Radicale versions with image updates

**Which should you use?**
- Use `tomsquest/docker-radicale:latest` for always-updated security patches
- Use `tomsquest/docker-radicale:$version` for stability with a specific Radicale version

### Version Tag Format

Version tags follow this format: `[Radicale version].[Image revision]`

For example, in `3.4.1.1`:
- `3.4.1` is the Radicale version
- The final `.1` is our image revision number (incremented for image-specific updates)

## Architectures

The image is built for two architectures:
- `amd64`: for your usual server
- `arm64`: for Raspberry Pi

When you run the image, Docker will automatically select the correct image architecture.

## Running

### Option 1: **Basic** instruction

```
docker run -d --name radicale \
    -p 5232:5232 \
    -v ./data:/data \
    tomsquest/docker-radicale
```

### Option 2: **Recommended, Production-grade** instruction (secured, safe...) :rocket:

This is the most secured instruction:

```
docker run -d --name radicale \
    -p 127.0.0.1:5232:5232 \
    --init \
    --read-only \
    --security-opt="no-new-privileges:true" \
    --cap-drop ALL \
    --cap-add CHOWN \
    --cap-add SETUID \
    --cap-add SETGID \
    --cap-add KILL \
    --pids-limit 50 \
    --memory 256M \
    --health-cmd="curl --fail http://localhost:5232 || exit 1" \
    --health-interval=30s \
    --health-retries=3 \
    -v ./data:/data \
    tomsquest/docker-radicale
```

Note on capabilities:
- `CHOWN` is used to restore the permission of the `data` directory. Remove this if you do not need the `chown` to be run (see [below](#volumes-versus-bind-mounts))
- `SETUID` and `SETGID` are used to run radicale as the less privileged `radicale` user (with su-exec), and are required.
- `KILL` is to allow Radicale to exit, and is required.

### Docker Compose

A [Docker compose file](docker-compose.yml) is included.

## Custom configuration

To change Radicale configuration, first get the config file:

* (Recommended) use this preconfigured [config file](config) from this repository,
* Or, use [the original Radicale config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kozea/Radicale/master/config) and:
  1. set `hosts = 0.0.0.0:5232`
  2. set `filesystem_folder = /data/collections`
  3. set `[auth] type = none`

Then:
1. create a config directory (eg. `mkdir -p /my_custom_config_directory`)
2. copy your config file into the config folder (e.g. `cp config /my_custom_config_directory/config`)
3. mount your custom config volume when running the container: `-v /my_custom_config_directory:/config:ro`.
The `:ro` at the end make the volume read-only, and is more secured.

## Authentication configuration

This section shows a basic example of configuring authentication for Radicale using htpasswd with bcrypt algorithm.  
To learn more, refer to [the official Radicale document](https://radicale.org/v3.html#auth).

First, we need to configure Radicale to use htpasswd authentication and specify htpasswd file's location.  
Create a `config` file inside the `config` directory (resulting in the path `config/config`).

```
[server]
hosts = 0.0.0.0:5232

[auth]
type = htpasswd
htpasswd_filename = /config/users
htpasswd_encryption = bcrypt

[storage]
filesystem_folder = /data/collections
```

Next, create a `users` file inside the `config` directory (resulting in the path `config/users`).  
Each line contains the username and bcrypt-hashed password, separated by a colon (`:`).

```
john:$2a$10$l1Se4qIaRlfOnaC1pGt32uNe/Dr61r4JrZQCNnY.kTx2KgJ70GPSm
sarah:$2a$10$lKEHYHjrZ.QHpWQeB/feWe/0m4ZtckLI.cYkVOITW8/0xoLCp1/Wy
```

Finally, create and run the container using the appropriate volume mount.
In this example, both files are stored in the same directory (`./config`).

```bash
docker run -d --name radicale tomsquest/docker-radicale \
    -p 5232:5232 \
    -v ./data:/data \
    -v ./config:/config:ro
```

## Volumes versus Bind-Mounts

This section is related to the error message `chown: /data: Permission denied`.

With [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/), and not [bind-mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) like shown in the examples above, you may need to disable the container trying to make the `data` directory writable.

This is done with the `TAKE_FILE_OWNERSHIP` environment variable.  
The variable will tell the container to perform or skip the `chown` instruction.  
The default value is `true`: the container will try to make the `data` directory writable to the `radicale` user.  

To disable the `chown`, declare the variable like this:

```
docker run -d --name radicale tomsquest/docker-radicale \
    -e "TAKE_FILE_OWNERSHIP=false"
```

## Running with Docker compose

A [Docker compose file](docker-compose.yml) is included.  
It can also be [extended](https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/#modify-your-compose-file-for-production).  
Make sure you have Docker compose version 2 or higher.

## Unraid

This image is compatible with Unraid, and you can find it in the [Community App store](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=radicale#r).

## Extending the image

The image is extendable, as per Docker image architecture. You need to create your own `Dockerfile`.

For example, here is how to add [RadicaleIMAP](https://github.com/Unrud/RadicaleIMAP) (authenticate by email) 
and [RadicaleInfCloud](https://www.inf-it.com/open-source/clients/infcloud/) (an alternative UI) to the image.

Please note that the [radicale-imap](https://gitlab.com/comzeradd/radicale-imap) plugin is not compatible with
Radicale 3.0 anymore!

First, create a `Dockerfile.extended` (pick the name you want) with this content:

```dockerfile
FROM tomsquest/docker-radicale

RUN /venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/Unrud/RadicaleIMAP
RUN /venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/Unrud/RadicaleInfCloud
```

Then, build and run it:

```bash
docker build -t radicale-extended -f Dockerfile.extended .
docker run --name radicale-extended -p 5232:5232 radicale-extended
```

### Birthday Calendar

[Christof Schulze](https://github.com/christf) provides an extended image to include [Radicale Birthday Calendar](https://github.com/iBigQ/radicale-birthday-calendar).

Find its [project here](https://github.com/christf/docker-radicale-birthday) to add a birthday calendar to your Radicale instance.

## Versioning with Git

Radicale supports a hook which is executed after each change to the CalDAV/CardDAV files.
This hook can be used to keep a versions of your CalDAV/CardDAV files through git.

This image provides `git` to support this feature. 

Refer to the [official documentation of Radicale](https://radicale.org/v3.html#versioning-with-git) for the details.

## Custom User/Group ID for the data volume

You will certainly mount a volume to keep Radicale data between restart/upgrade of the container.
But sharing files from the host and the container can be problematic.
The reason is that `radicale` user **in** the container does not match the user running the container **on** the host.

To solve this, this image offers four options (see below for details):

- Option 0: Do nothing, permission will be fixed by the container itself
- Option 1: Create a user/group with id `2999` on the host
- Option 2: Force the user/group ids on `docker run`
- Option 3: Build the image with a custom user/group

### Option 0: Do nothing, permission will be fixed by the container itself

When running the container with a /data volume (e.g. `-v ./data:/data`), the container entrypoint will automatically fix the permissions on `/data`.

This option is OK, but not optimal:
- Ok for the container, as inside the container, the `radicale` user can read and write its data
- But on the host, the data directory will then be owned by the user/group 2999:2999

### Option 1: Create a user/group with id `2999` on the host

The image creates a user and a group with id `2999` in the container.  
You can create a user/group on your host matching this id.

Example:

```bash
# On your host
sudo addgroup --gid 2999 radicale
sudo adduser --gid 2999 --uid 2999 --shell /bin/false --disabled-password --no-create-home radicale
```

### Option 2: Force the user/group ids on `docker run`

The user and group ids used in the container can be overridden when the container is run.  
This is done with the `UID` and `GID` env variables, e.g. `docker run -e UID=123 -e GID=456 ...`.  
This will force all operations to be run with this UID/GID.

:warning: The **`--read-only`** run flag cannot be used in this case. 
Using custom UID/GID tries to modify the filesystem at runtime but this is made **impossible** by the `--read-only` flag.

### Option 3: Build the image with a custom user/group

You can build the image with custom user and group ids and still use the `--read-only` flag.  
But you will have to clone this repo, do a local build and keep up with changes of this image.

Usage: `docker build --build-arg=BUILD_UID=5000 --build-arg=BUILD_GID=5001 ...`.

`BUILD_UID` and `BUILD_GID` are also supported as environment variables to work around a problem on some Synology NAS. See this PR#68.

## Running with Podman

Two users have given the instructions they used to run the image with Podman:
- [@greylinux's instructions](https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale/issues/122#issuecomment-1361240992)
- [@strauss115's instructions](https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale/issues/122#issuecomment-1874607285)

## Running behind Caddy

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) is sitting in front of all my self-hosted services, like Radicale.  
It brings https and security (basic authentication).

The following Caddyfile works for me. Note that I don't use Radicale authentication, I have only one user.

```caddyfile
radicale.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5232

    basicauth {
        tom pas$w0rd
    }
}
```

## Contributing

To run the tests:

1. `uv sync`
2. `uv run pytest -v`

## Releasing

1. Create a Git tag, e.g. `1.2.3.4`, push it and the CI will build the images and publish them on Docker hub
2. Update the `latest` tag
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` (after, or in the PR)
3. Create release on GitHub (`Draft a new release` > pick the tag > `Generate release notes` > `Publish release`)

Example instructions :

```bash
# Update local tags
git fetch --all --tags
# Create tag
TAG=1.2.3.4 && git tag $TAG && git push origin $TAG
# Draft a new release
xdg-open https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale/releases/new
```

Note: the `latest` tag is generated automatically on each push (and daily).
